## Anti Cheat
- **This application is completely harmless for `Roblox` because it has no injection and won't touch the `Roblox` process, this is just keeping mouse position on the same place.**

## FAQ
1. **Why is anti virus detecting it?**
- It shouldn't because the application just sets the mouse to prevent moving out the window of Roblox.
- But here is a virus scan anyway: [hybrid-analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/13d8444374f058ec2a9d286e253910f93ceef0e73d05e10909138c41f9e6cfad) and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/MzM0YjA4MmQwNTI4YjEyMmFmMzdkOWI5NmYyNWQ5NzE6MTY4NzE0Njk2Mw==)

2. **How to turn it on or off?**
- Press `INSERT` key or what ever you set to turn on and off.

3. **Why is it stopped working?**
- Try reopening it, because it might be some issue or bug.

4. **How do i uninstall CursorFix?**
- Simply just by closing the application and deleting it.

5. **Will the keybind support multi-key keybinds?**
- Lmao na I'm way to lazy to add support for that.  Feel free to add code to do it tho its prob not hard.
